# workout-tracker
My Database Systems final project

This project uses a database to store a user's workout data. The home page shows a dropdown menu, where users can select one of the 5 days (muscle groups) to see a sample workout I hardcoded in, with optimal rep ranges. There are text and number fields, where the user can enter an exercise from the sample workouts or one of his/her choosing, then enter in the sets, reps, and weight. After submitting a form for each exercise, the data is stored on another page, and an incrementing ID is given to every exercise, and all the information is displayed in a table.
